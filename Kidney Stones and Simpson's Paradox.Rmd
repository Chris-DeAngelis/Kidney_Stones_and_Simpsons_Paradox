In 1986, a group of urologists in London published a research paper in The British Medical Journal that compared the effectiveness of two different methods to remove kidney stones. Treatment A was open surgery (invasive), and treatment B was percutaneous nephrolithotomy (less invasive). When they looked at the results from 700 patients, treatment B had a higher success rate. However, when they only looked at the subgroup of patients different kidney stone sizes, treatment A had a better success rate. What is going on here? This known statistical phenomenon is called Simponâ€™s paradox. Simpon's paradox occurs when trends appear in subgroups but disappear or reverse when subgroups are combined.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load the readr and dplyr packages
library(readr) # Reading in CSV data
library(dplyr) # Manipulating data
library(ggplot2) # Graphing data
library(broom) # Summarizes statistical models and information

# Read datasets kidney_stone_data.csv into data
data <- read_csv("https://github.com/topherdea/Kidney_Stones_and_Simpsons_Paradox/blob/master/kidney_stone_data.csv")

# Take a look at the first few rows of the dataset
head(data, 6)
```

First, I familiarized myself with the dataset. I worked with 3 columns: treatment (A or B), stone_size (large or small), and success (0 = failure or 1 = success). I first looked at which treatments had higher success rates regardless of stone size. It appears treatment B performed better on average than treatment A (82% vs 78%). Then, I looked at the same results after considering stone size. 

```{r exploratory}
# Calculate the number and frequency of success and failure of each treatment 
data %>% 
  group_by(treatment, success) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Freq = round(N/sum(N), digits = 3))

# Calculate number and frequency of success and failure by stone size for each treatment
sum_data <- 
  data %>% 
  group_by(treatment, stone_size, success) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>%
  mutate(Freq = round(N/sum(N),digits = 3))

# Print out the data frame we just created
print(sum_data)

# Create a bar plot to show stone size count within each treatment
sum_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = N)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = stone_size), stat='identity') 
```

From the chart it appears large kidney stones appeared to be in test A whereas small kidney stones appeared in test B. To confirm that stone size is the confounding variable, I used a Chi-Square test. Then, I used multiple logistic regression to remove the unwanted effect of stone size.

```{r modeling}
# Run a Chi-squared test
trt_ss <- chisq.test(data$treatment, data$stone_size)

# Print out the result in tidy format 
tidy(trt_ss)

# Run a multiple logistic regression
m <- glm(data = data, success ~ stone_size + treatment, family = "binomial")

# Print out model coefficient table in tidy format
tidy(m)

# Save the tidy model output into an object
tidy_m <- tidy(m)

# Plot the coefficient estimates with 95% CI for each term in the model
tidy_m %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = term, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = estimate - 1.96 * std.error, 
                      ymax = estimate + 1.96 * std.error)) +
 geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
